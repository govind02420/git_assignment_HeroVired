## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Usage

1. **Add the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/govind02420/git_assignment_HeroVired.git
   cd git_assignment_HeroVired
   ```

2. **Run the calculator:**
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Branching Strategy

- **main**: Stable, production-ready code.
- **dev**: Development branch for integrating new features and bug fixes.
- **feature/sqrt**: Feature branch for adding square root functionality.

---

## üîÑ Workflow Summary

1. **Repository Setup**
   - Created private repo: `git_assignment_HeroVired`
   - Added collaborator for code review

2. **Development**
   - Created `dev` branch for development
   
   ```bash
   git checkout -b dev
   ```
   
   - Added initial calculator code (`calculator.py`)
   
```python
import math

class Calculator:

    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def subtract(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    def multiply(self, a, b):
        return a * b

    def divide(self, a, b):
    #    if b == 0:
    #       raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        return a / b
# TODO: Implement the following function to calculate the square root of a number.
    # def square_root(self, x):
    #     return math.sqrt(x)
# You need to uncomment the above function and complete its implementation to add the square root feature.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculator = Calculator()

num1 = 16
num2 = 4

print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {calculator.add(num1, num2)}")
print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {calculator.subtract(num1, num2)}") 
print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {calculator.multiply(num1, num2)}")
print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {calculator.divide(num1, num2)}")

# TODO: Uncomment and test the square root feature.
# num3 = 25
# print(f"The square root of {num3} = {calculator.square_root(num3)}")
```
- Add, Commit and Push `dev`
   ```bash
   git add calculator.py
   git commit -m "Add CalculatorPlus basic operations code"
   git push origin dev
   ```
- Merged `dev` into `main` for v1.0 release
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge dev
   git push origin main
   ```
- Create a GitHub Release (`Version 1`) for the **CalculatorPlus app**

> To create a new release for this project on GitHub, follow these steps:
>
> 1.  Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
> 2.  Click on the **Releases** tab (usually found near the top of the page, under the repository name).
> 3.  Click the **Draft a new release** button.
> 4.  In the **Tag version** field, enter `v1.0`.
> 5.  In the **Release title** field, enter `CalculatorPlus - Version 1`.
> 6.  In the **Description** field, add a brief summary of the release : `Initial release of CalculatorPlus app with basic arithmetic operations.`
> 7.  Click the **Publish release** button.
>
> This will create a new release tag (`v1.0`) and a release entry on your repository's releases page.

3. **Feature Addition**
   - Created `feature/sqrt` branch from `dev`
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git checkout -b feature/sqrt
   git push origin main
   ```
   - Implemented `square_root` function
   
```python
# You need to uncomment the above function and complete its implementation to add the square root feature.

# TODO: Implement the following function to calculate the square root of a number.
     def square_root(self, x):
         return math.sqrt(x)

# TODO: Uncomment and test the square root feature.
 num3 = 25
 print(f"The square root of {num3} = {calculator.square_root(num3)}")
```
- Add, Commit and Push `feature/sqrt`
   ```bash
   git add calculator.py
   git commit -m "Add squre root functionality"
   git push origin feature/sqrt
   ```
   
4. **Bug Fix**
   - Merged fix into `feature/sqrt`
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   ```
   - Fixed division by zero bug in `dev`
   ```python
   # You need to uncomment the if in divide function and Fixed division by zero bug.
    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
           raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero.")
        return a / b   
   ```
   - Commit fix and Push `dev`
   ```bash
   git add calculator.py
   git commit -m "Fix divide function to prevent division by zero"
   git push origin dev
   ```
   - Merged fix into `feature/sqrt`
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/sqrt
   git merge dev
   git push origin feature/sqrt
   ```
5. **Pull Request & Review**
   - Opened PR from `feature/sqrt` to `main`
   - Requested review from collaborator

6. **Release Management**
   - Merged feature branch after review
   - Released v2.0 with new features and bug fix
